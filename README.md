What is difference between zip and unzip
Both zip and unzip are command-line utilities used to compress and extract files in the .zip format.

ZIP - COMPRESS /ARCHIVE FILES

Used to create .zip archives (compressed file containers).
Syntax
 zip archive_name.zip file1 file2 folder/

 example

CMD# zip myfiles.zip report.txt notes.txt folder/
This creates myfiles.zip containing the specified files and folder.

 unzip ‚Äî Extract .zip Archives
Used to extract files from .zip archives.

Syntax
unzip archive_name.zip

example

CMD# unzip myfiles.zip
This extracts the contents of myfiles.zip to the current directory.


üñ•Ô∏è Installation (if not preinstalled):
On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt install zip unzip

On RHEL/CentOS:


sudo yum install zip unzip

On macOS (via Homebrew):

brew install zip unzip


Command	       Purpose	                   Common Use

================================================================================
why we use " mv terraform /usr/local/bin


mv terraform /usr/local/bin

is used to move the Terraform binary (terraform) into a directory that's included in the system's PATH environment variable.



‚úÖ Why this is done:
Makes Terraform available system-wide:

After moving to /usr/local/bin, you can run terraform from any directory, without specifying the full path.

/usr/local/bin is in the PATH:

This is a standard location for user-installed software binaries on Linux/macOS.

The shell looks in this directory when you type a command.



üß† Example Scenario:
You download Terraform as a binary (e.g., terraform).

It's saved in your Downloads or extracted folder.

You move it to a system-wide executable path:


================================================================================================


üíª What is a Binary in computing?
A binary (or binary file) is a compiled executable program ‚Äî it's a file that your computer's processor can directly run.

‚úÖ Simple Definition:
A binary is a program that has been compiled from source code into machine code, ready to run on your operating system.

üß† Key Points:
Term	Meaning
Source code	Human-readable code (e.g., in Python, Go, C++)
Compile	Convert source code to machine-readable code
Binary file	The result of compiling ‚Äî an executable program

üß∞ Example:
You download terraform as a single file:

bash

./terraform
That file is a binary executable ‚Äî already compiled and ready to run, without needing source code.
